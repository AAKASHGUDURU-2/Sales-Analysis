# Sales-Analysis
Things I have learnt:
1. Make sure to mention the encoding script if its not jupyers default
2. Make sure to handle the NULL values. Here as we have city names no need of Postal Code.
3. Profit Margin = Profit / Sales
4. Not only overall profit margin but by category gives more details.
5. If you are already working with a grouped/summarized table, you don't need to aggregate again; you just need to "Transform" or "Apply" calculations to the existing rows. We used split, apply and combine strategy
6.
